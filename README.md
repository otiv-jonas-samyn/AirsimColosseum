# Welcome to Colosseum, a successor of [AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim)
  
## Unreal Engine Version for Main Branch
[Unreal Engine fork](https://github.com/OTIVai/OTIV-UnrealEngine)

  
## Introduction
  
Colosseum is a simulator for robotic, autonomous systems, built on [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) (we now also have an experimental [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) release). It is open-source, cross platform, and supports software-in-the-loop simulation with popular flight controllers such as PX4 & ArduPilot and hardware-in-loop with PX4 for physically and visually realistic simulations. It is developed as an Unreal plugin that can simply be dropped into any Unreal environment. Similarly, we have an experimental release for a Unity plugin.
  
This is a fork of the AirSim repository, which Microsoft decided to shutdown in July of 2022. This fork serves as a waypoint to building a new and better simulation platform. The creater and maintainer of this fork is Codex Laboratories LLC (our website is [here](https://www.codex-labs-llc.com)). Colosseum is one of the underlying simulation systems that we use in our product, the [SWARM Simulation Platform](https://www.swarmsim.io). This platform exists to provide pre-built tools and low-code/no-code autonomy solutions. Please feel free to check this platform out and reach out if interested.
